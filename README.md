# Life Expectancy Analysis üåç

## Project Overview üöÄ

The **Life Expectancy Analysis** project explores global life expectancy trends, focusing in East Asia Pacific and on how Economic, Healthcare Access and Quality, Education and Social Factors, Demographic and Health Outcomes and Environmental Factors influence the average lifespan of populations. As a data analyst, the goal is to provide actionable insights to policymakers, researchers, and health organizations, helping them understand the determinants of life expectancy and how different factors correlate with population health outcomes.

By leveraging various data science techniques, this project aims to identify key drivers of life expectancy and predict future trends based on multiple factors.

## Background üìö

Life expectancy is a key indicator of a country's overall health and well-being, often used by policymakers to measure the quality of life and access to healthcare. It is affected by a wide variety of factors, including but not limited to:

- **Socio-economic factors**: GDP per capita, income inequality, education levels.
- **Healthcare**: Access to medical facilities, healthcare infrastructure, vaccination rates.
- **Environmental factors**: Air quality, water availability, pollution levels.
- **Lifestyle choices**: Diet, exercise habits, smoking rates, alcohol consumption.
- **Demographic factors**: Age, gender, and population density.

In recent years, life expectancy has been rising in many developed nations but remains a significant challenge in low-income countries. Understanding the correlations between these factors and life expectancy can guide interventions to improve public health.

## Methodology & Strategy üîç

To conduct a comprehensive life expectancy analysis, the following methodology was employed:

### 1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**
   - **Source**: The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from reputable global databases, such as the World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO), and includes data for multiple countries over several decades.
   - **Cleaning**: The data was cleaned to remove missing values, handle outliers, and ensure consistency across all features. Categorical data was encoded appropriately, and numerical features were scaled for modeling.

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - The first step involved exploring the dataset visually and statistically to identify trends, patterns, and potential correlations between life expectancy and various socio-economic, healthcare, and environmental factors.
   - Key visualizations such as heatmaps, scatter plots, and correlation matrices were used to uncover the relationships between features.

### 3. **Feature Engineering**
   - Derived new features based on domain knowledge (e.g., average healthcare spending per capita, urbanization rates).
   - Applied transformation techniques such as log transformation on skewed data (e.g., GDP per capita) to improve model performance.

### 4. **Modeling & Predictive Analysis**
   - Several machine learning models were trained to predict life expectancy:
     - **Linear Regression**: To model the relationship between life expectancy and predictor variables.
     - **Random Forest Regression**: To capture non-linear relationships and feature interactions.
     - **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)**: To improve predictive accuracy and handle complex relationships in the data.
   - Hyperparameter tuning was performed using grid search to optimize the models.

## Solution üí°

The key solution to this project was building a predictive model that can estimate life expectancy based on multiple factors such as income, healthcare, education, and environmental conditions.

### Key Insights from the Solution:
- **Economic Development**: Countries with higher GDP per capita tend to have higher life expectancy, though this relationship can vary in lower-income countries.
- **Healthcare Access**: There is a strong correlation between life expectancy and access to healthcare services. Countries with a higher number of healthcare providers (doctors per capita) and better health infrastructure generally exhibit higher life expectancy.
- **Environmental Impact**: Poor air quality and lack of access to clean water are associated with lower life expectancy, particularly in developing countries.
- **Education and Lifestyle**: Higher education levels and healthier lifestyle choices (e.g., lower smoking rates, better diet) correlate with longer life expectancy.

The models developed as part of this analysis can also be used to predict life expectancy based on existing or projected data, offering a forecasting tool for future trends in public health.

## Results & Output üìä

The analysis and modeling produced several valuable insights and outcomes:

1. **Key Predictive Factors**: The model identified the most important predictors of life expectancy, such as healthcare access, GDP per capita, and air quality.
2. **Predictive Model Performance**:
   - **Linear Regression**: Achieved an R¬≤ score of 0.75, indicating a strong fit for predicting life expectancy.
   - **Random Forest Regression**: Achieved an R¬≤ score of 0.85, providing better accuracy by capturing non-linear relationships.
   - **XGBoost**: The best-performing model, achieving an R¬≤ score of 0.89 with optimized hyperparameters.
3. **Global Trends**: Through visualizations, the analysis revealed global life expectancy trends and the disparity between developed and developing countries.
4. **Visualization Tools**: Interactive charts and dashboards were created to present the findings, enabling users to explore trends by region, year, and country.

These insights are crucial for healthcare organizations, governments, and policymakers to make data-informed decisions to improve the quality of life and longevity of populations.

## Responsibilities & Scope üìã

### **Responsibilities:**
- **Data Collection & Preprocessing**: Gathering reliable data, cleaning and transforming it for further analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing and identifying key relationships in the data.
- **Modeling**: Training, evaluating, and fine-tuning multiple predictive models.
- **Reporting**: Creating clear visualizations and reports to communicate findings effectively.

### **Scope**:
This project is designed to:
- Analyze the current state of life expectancy across different regions.
- Predict future life expectancy trends using machine learning models.
- Offer actionable insights to help stakeholders understand the factors influencing life expectancy and health outcomes.

The project will focus on global life expectancy but can be adapted to focus on specific countries or regions based on the available dataset.
